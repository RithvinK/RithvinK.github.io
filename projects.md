Here is a non-exhaustive list of my non-research projects. My research work can be found <a href="/research">here</a>. You can also check out my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/thearyanmittal">here</a> for a complete list of my projects.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Atlanta Home Rental Price Prediction</b>: A data science project aimed at predicting the prices of home rentals in the Atlanta region. Data was scraped from the Georgia MLS site. I performed extensive cleaning and preprocessing measures on the dataset and visualized the correlation between home rental price and various features and factors. I evaluated the performance of multiple regression models on the dataset and built a model that accurately predicts home rental prices to within roughly $600.<br>

		<b>The Tank</b>: We created a fully remote-controlled model tank with a laser pointer turret and an onboard camera that streamed live 720p60 video to a web server from scratch over 4 weeks. I was responsible for writing the software for the controller, tank motion, online streaming video server, and communication between the remote control and tank. We presented this project at the GHP (Governor's Honors Program) 58 Engineering Expo to GHP students and faculty.<br>

It was used by small business owners during COVID-19 to help enforce mask-required policies at their stores.<br>
