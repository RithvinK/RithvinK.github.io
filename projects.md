		<b>UPS Hackathon Project: Personal Vehicle Driver App</b>: This app was designed for the UPS Hackathon. A personal vehicle driver is someone who helps with deliveries during peak delivery season, where they utilize their personal vehicles to pick up and deliver packages as a third-party employer of UPS. Our team designed an app for PVDs to sign on, register their vehicles, and receive their assigned packages to deliver based on their vehicle space and selection. These packages are assigned using an algorithm that maximizes the packages assigned by assigning the biggest packages available that fit in the vehicle and then move on to smaller packages. <br>

		<b>The Tank</b>: We created a fully remote-controlled model tank with a laser pointer turret and an onboard camera that streamed live 720p60 video to a web server from scratch over 4 weeks. I was responsible for writing the software for the controller, tank motion, online streaming video server, and communication between the remote control and tank. We presented this project at the GHP (Governor's Honors Program) 58 Engineering Expo to GHP students and faculty.<br>

		<b>Facial Recognition and Mask Detection</b>: A Python facial recognition program that identifies and labels faces in live webcam feed. It also detects whether a face mask is being worn properly. It was used by small business owners during COVID-19 to help enforce mask-required policies at their stores.<br>
