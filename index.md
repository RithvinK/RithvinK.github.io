Hi! I'm Aryan, a Mathematics and Computer Science student at Georgia Tech.

I'm interested in the fields of combinatorics, game theory, data science, and their real-world applications in areas such as sports analytics and operations research. 

In my free time, I am an avid Atlanta sports fan. When I'm not busy cheering on my Braves, Falcons, or Yellow Jackets, you can probably find me playing Catan with friends or watching a movie.
