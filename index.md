Hello! I am Rithvin Koneru, a Computer Science major and business minor at the University of Maryland heading into my junior year. I am a passionate and driven programmer with a curious nature. I enjoy learning new technologies and concepts as well as taking on challenging problems.

Currently looking for internships in software engineering/FinTech to apply my interests/knowledge to real-world business problems. My interests include the fields of software development, finance/business, and artificial intelligence.

Outside of career interests, I enjoy playing the piano, watching movies/sports(Go Jets!), working out, and being outdoors.
