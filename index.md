Hello! I am Rithvin Koneru, a Computer Science major and business minor at the University of Maryland heading into my junior year.

My interests include the fields of software development, financial tech, and artificial intelligence.

Outside of career interests, I enjoy playing the piano, watching movies/sports, and working out.
